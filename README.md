[Data Summary from Week 2](https://bl.ocks.org/sajudson/d1094a88bc612e2b0d8ac7952080f0db)

This data set contains the total annual global carbon emssions, in units of one million metric tons of carbon, from 1751 to 2014, by source. The sources of these emissions include combustion of fossil fuels (gas, liquid, and solid), cement manufacturing, and gas flaring. Per capita emissions data is provided starting in 1950, once reliable global population estimate were available

This data was compiled by the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/&sa=D&ust=1505598980404000&usg=AFQjCNE2q30jmgOabhyONR2h038d32fyjQ)

The original electronic file is [Global CO2 Emissions from fossil fuel buring, cement manufacturing, and gas flaring](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2014.ems)/ This file was imported into excel and saved as a CSV file. 

Note that CDIAC is shutting down on September 30, 2017. This data will be transferred to the LBNL [ESS-DIVE](http://ess-dive.lbl.gov/) web site after September, 30, 2017.

The link to the CDIAC website was found on [gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/), which contains other data sources that may be of interest if this data set is used for my visualization project.

[Data Summary from Week2](https://bl.ocks.org/sajudson/772c6d0f442c16f98928bf5831646cb0)
The data set contains the number of bike share system users (casual and registered) for each day (and hour) for two years (Jan 2011 - Dec 2012), as well as the day type (holiday, workingday), weather situation, temperature and humidity, apparent temperature and windspeed.

This data is from [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Bike Sharing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)

The dataset file can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip) as a zip archive.
